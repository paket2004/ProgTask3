# Transportation Problem Solver
This project provides a Python implementation of three popular methods for solving transportation problems: North-West Corner Method, Vogel's Approximation Method, and Russell's Approximation Method.
# Problem Statement
Given the supply and demand constraints, along with the costs associated with transporting goods between sources and destinations, the goal is to find the optimal transportation plan that minimizes the total cost.
# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
## Usage
# Define the Linear Programming Problem
